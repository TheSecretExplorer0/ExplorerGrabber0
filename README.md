This is for educational purposes, this is a simple python script I made using a discord webhook.

Made by TheSecretExplorer0

FEATURES:

HOW TO USE:

Step 1. Download the script

Step 2. Modify the script using vs, make sure you have the proper modules installed and also you need Python +3

Step 3. Go to the last lines of the script where it says "YOUR_WEEBHOK_URL" insert your own webhook

Step 4. Run the exe file to check for dependecies and all proper modules installed (You are good to go if the console opens for a split second and closes)

Step 5. Install auto-py-to-exe to convert script to exe (Make sure you saved changes)

Step 6. Go to cmd and type auto-py-to-exe from the select your main script as the script your modified, select one file, and console based or Windows based (Works for both)

Step 7. Enjoy the script

NOTE

It is very likely that when running the ModuleChecker.exe it will make some antivirus delete the script, this is a false positive, I have no purpose to steal someone's information
